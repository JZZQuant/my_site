title: "Image reconstruction from curved manifolds"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'In this article, we briefly describe various tools and approaches that algebraic geometry has to offer to straighten bent objects. Throughout this article we will consider a specific example of a bent or curved piece of paper which in our case acts very much like an elastica curve. We conclude this article with a suggestion to algebraic geometry as a viable and fast performance alternative of neural networks in vision and machine learning. The purpose of this article is not to build a full blown framework but to show possibility of using algebraic geometry as an alternative to neural networks for recognizing or extracting features on manifolds.'
