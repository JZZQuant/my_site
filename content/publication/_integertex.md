title: "A novel approach for solving integer equal flow problems using algebraic geometry"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'In this article we consider a certain sub class of Integer Equal Flow problem, which are known NP hard [8]. Currently there exist no direct solutions for the same. It is a common problem in various inventory management systems. Here we discuss a local minima solution which uses projection of the convex spaces to resolve the equal flows and turn the problem into a known linear integer programming or constraint satisfaction problem which have reasonable known solutions and can be effectively solved using simplex or other standard optimization strategies.'
